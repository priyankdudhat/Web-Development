                <p>Industry 4.0 is a strategic initiative which the
                    German government has introduced. Which outlines and encapsulates
                    a set of technological changes in manufacturing and sets
                    out the goals of a comprehensive policy agenda with a view to
                    preserving the global competitiveness of the German industry.
                    Industry 4.0 has purchased a range of professional improvements
                    in the working strategies of workers. In industry, workers are
                    obliged to learn modern, daily jobs, but are now often required
                    to use high-tech gadgets. Industry 4.0 has purchased a range of

                <p>We have been surrounded by advanced technologies that
                    transform every aspect of our lives, as well as the production
                    manufacturing processes. From the first British industrial
                    revolution to the fourth industrial revolution, there has been
                    dramatic changes through digitalization which change the
                    humans lifestyle and communication style with each others.[1]
                </p>
                <p>The First Industrial Revolution begun from 1780s with
                    introduction of mechanical production facilities with the help
                    of water and steam power. Next Industrial revolution 2.0
                    – “Electrification and Industrialization” defined as a mass
                    production, For example steel revolution in manufacturing. In
                    this revolution period advent of the assembly line, electrical
                    power , telephone, refrigerator as well as washing machines.
                </p>
                <p>At the time of 20th century, Industry 3.0 begun with the introduction
                    of the digital revolution. This revolution witnessed
                    exponential technology like 3D Printing, Big Data, Internet
                    and huge development in Computers, Information and Communication
                    technology industries. Industry 4.0 is presented as an overall change
                    in the digitalization of every part of the
                    company as well as in the manufacturing process..[2]

                <p>In details of how 4th revolution idea is raised, first of all
                    as per one report of 2010, The German Federal Ministry of
                    Economic Affairs for Energy presents a range of technological
                    commitments which need to be promoted in order to
                    strengthen Germany’s position as a leading producer. Modern
                    manufacturing technologies, optical technologies, microsystem
                    technologies, nanotechnology, bio technologies, electronics,
                    new materials and geo-technology are perceived to realize this
                    potential.
                </p>
                <p>As per survey conducted by the Capgemini Consulting,
                    they made an Industry 4.0 Framework to explain future
                    development in manufacturing. And they found that following
                    four technologies affect the manufacturing sector in positive
                    manner: Cloud Computing, Advance Analytics, Community
                    Platform and 3D Printing.The paper structured as follows:
                    section 2 presents the Reference Architecture Model I4.0.
                    section 3 presents key technologies or characteristics of I4.0.
                    And section 4 and 5 about design principal of I4.0 and
                    conclusion respectively.[3]

            <article>
                <p>Several German institutions and associations cooperated on
                    the creation of the reference model for I4.0. The below 3D architecture
                    model fig. 2 is the development of a shared language
                    and a structured framework that describes the fundamental
                    bases of I4.0. It is intended to assist in the implementation of
                    I4.0 advanced technology. The Reference Architecture Model I4.0 (RAMI4.0)
                    should able to identify the existing standards
                    and among it, identify and close the gaps, loopholes and
                    identify overlaps.

                    all the level of the enterprise, from product manufacturing to
                    the world. The ”connect world” is the final stage of the I4.0
                    business development environment that IOT and IOS use to

                    a variety of functions that can be remotely accessed due to the
                    need for data integrity. It’s about the company procedures. It
                    gives rise to the logic of rules and decisions. The “Business
                    Layer” enables the mapping of the business model and the
                    linking of the different business models. It ensures the integrity
                    of the functions within the value stream.
                    It is possible to map all the crucial aspects of Industry
                    4.0 that allow the classification of objects such as machines
                    according to the model. This model enables the step-bystep
                    migration from the actual manufacturing environment to
                    the future. For the first time, Industry 4.0 is compiled as
                    RAMI4.0 and registered in Germany under the DIN SPEC
                    91345 standard. [1][5]

                        <p><strong> Big Data Analytics:</strong><br>
                            In the context of Industry 4.0, big data is a helpful for the
                            companies to do prediction of production in the future and this
                            technology important factor for rapid and fast development of
                            industries though the IoT. This leads to a huge amount of
                            information produced and obtained daily, where the current
                            processing and analysis cannot be carried out using traditional
                            methods. Big data has therefore recently become a hot topic
                            in I4.0.Several other applications would be able to acquire
                            additional value if existing techniques were to become more
                            advanced in the ability to handle of big data. Big data is the
                            use of digital technologies for analysis purposes. As defined
                            by Forrester, ”Big Data” can be divided into four dimensions:
                            volume, variety, value and velocity.[2][5]</p>

                        <p><strong>B. Autonomous Robots:</strong><br>
                            Currently available robots are constructed with more advanced
                            functionalities and more flexible as well as easy to
                            handle by normal people. In the short time of period robots
                            will interact with each other and actively do collaborations
                            with the humans in the advise of the managers. In the feature
                            these robots will become a more and more cheaper and
                            advanced to achieve the position in the industries.[2][5]</p>

                        <p><strong>C. Simulation:</strong><br>
                            Simulation is one more important aspects in Industry 4.0,
                            which helps to developed well planned and experimental
                            models to optimize and rebuilt the complex operations and
                            automated production systems. Simulation architecture build
                            of using currently available data to represent the original
                            world and this model is combination of workers, products
                            and different machineries. Simulation concept is also know
                            as virtual reality. For example, now driving schools have a
                            simulation machine for virtual driving.[2][5]</p>

                        <p><strong>D. Horizontal and Vertical System Integration:</strong><br>
                            Vertical integration refers to flexible and reconfigurable
                            systems within the factory and to the extent to which they are
                            fully integrated with each other to achieve agility; horizontal
                            integration deals with the integration of partners within the
                            Supply Chain(SC). The industrial network collects Big Data
                            in order to optimize the performance of the system and
                            send it to the cloud. This coordination mechanism is the
                            framework of the smart factory. Manufacturing systems are
                            therefore designed as a self-organized structure that integrates
                            all physical objects into each other through smart networks.
                            In addition, cloud-based systems enable vertical partners to
                            integrate with each other through shared platforms. Product
                            and process flows would be visualized and monitored by SC
                            members (Wang et al., 2016).[6]</p>

                        <p><strong>E. Internet of Things (IoT):</strong><br>
                            IoT refers to the next technological revolution by providing
                            solutions for computing, analytics, etc., and relying on cloudbased
                            systems. The main task of IoT is to connect to the
                            Internet by collecting data from physical objects. By collecting
                            data, computers or higher-level devices make an operational
                            decision. By using IoT, business operations become more agile
                            and integrated, as well as competitive advantage on the basis
                            of SC.</p>

                        <p><strong>F. The Cloud Computing:</strong><br>
                            Cloud Computing (CC) brings different advantages to the
                            ICT paradigm, such as helping SCs automate and integrate,
                            but also facilitating management and administration. It’s a
                            way to virtualize resources and services and to combine a
                            client/server-based system. CC includes a pool of IT resources
                            that offer storage and processing capabilities in a virtual
                            system by serving multiple users. There are three models of
                            cloud computing; first one is Software as a Service (SaaS)
                            where access depends on customer purchases such as ERP,
                            second model is Service (PaaS) where customers are allowed
                            to access their cloud applications such as software developers
                            and third model Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offers basic
                            activities such as storage capabilities. The best example of
                            cloud systems are Google Drive, Windows Azure and Blue
                            Cloud.[2][5]</p>
